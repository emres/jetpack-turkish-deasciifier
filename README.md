# turkish-deasciifier: Turkish deasciifier

This is a deasciifier for Turkish. It takes a Turkish string (that is in a text
box or a text area) containing only ASCII characters and replaces the relevant
characters with their corresponding Turkish letters.

This system is based on the [Mustafa Emre Acer's](http://www.mustafaacer.com)
[Javascript implementation](http://turkce-karakter.appspot.com/) of
[turkish-mode](http://github.com/emres/turkish-mode) by [Dr. Deniz
YÃ¼ret](http://denizyuret.blogspot.com).
